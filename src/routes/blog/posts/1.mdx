# Getting Started with Qwik

Qwik is a new kind of web framework that can deliver instant loading web applications at any size or complexity. Let's explore how to get started with it.

## Why Qwik?

Qwik is designed to solve the JavaScript bundle size problem by introducing a new way of thinking about how we load and execute JavaScript in the browser.

## Installation

```bash
npm create qwik@latest
```

## Basic Concepts

### Components

Qwik components are defined using the `component$` function:

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  return <div>Hello Qwik!</div>;
});
```

### State Management

Qwik provides powerful state management through signals:

```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);

  return (
    <button onClick$={() => count.value++}>
      Count: {count.value}
    </button>
  );
});
```
