# About Me
Tech enthusiast, cyclist , hobbyst runner and a passionate learner. Finding my way into technology by the back hallways of college.<br/> It led me to 42, Where I consolidated my knowledge and skills around   coding but also   software development as whole.

##  The Pandemic Year...
I was due to start in  2020 during summer ... it started in march 2021. During that wait, I made the most of my time by doing  learning on my own . I  tried many courses and books   explored different tech stacks, working with frontend technologies like React, ReScript, ReasonML and ClojureScript, plus some Node.js stuff on the side also a litle of nosql (i was not ready yet) .

##  The 42 Journey
42 is a "half structured" program. you are given
projects but no  formal class & teacher  or even due date. Well there was a due date but it would mean i would be let go from the school. **[42](https://www.42.fr/)**. <br/> We were the first batch of students to join the program. I learn quite a bit about system programing and also being pragmatic and thorough. Asking another student for help was a great way to learn and grow. The program also drive you to collaboration since its other who correct your work ..

About Halfway throught my time at 42, I was contacted by a Founder at a Startup. I was super lucky to be able to get this opportunity looking back! I was able to grasp the  product pretty quickly since it was EdTech. I was quickly onboarded and started contributing to the product. I did not even know the framework they were using but i was quick to grasp  it's root and functionality.

The team was distributed across **Quebec**, and though we mostly worked remotely, we managed to meet up in person a couple of times. I had a unique setup - working from my school office rather than a traditional workplace. I was  at the school campus almost every day.I do not know but it felt better sometimes than just staying home.I  really enjoyed being to be in this position.

But as they say, all good things must come to an end. When March rolled around, my internship officially wrapped up, though I stayed on part-time for a few more months to help out where I could.

## The   Moving  era
Since I was not actually finished from school, I had many projects that were yet due to be completed. I spent a lot of my energy on them. I kept the web technologies in mind with influencer contents with their technologies take / tech stack to stay updated.

Also kept a tab open to find my next opportunity.
I did not mind working with different technologies.
I was already pretty well versed in web and system programming.

I was in for such an exciting treat because that's exactly what happened! I managed to land a job as an embedded Developer at an Electric bus company. I got to join a new team (which was just me at first!).
I had the chance to explore  CANBUS (some binary format)
I spent time reading and exploring the old code-base while adding my own contributions. at some point the  idea that  computer should be updatable remotely without physical presence (no wifi present on device).
I  read through the documentation and poked the hardware.
The program we needed wasn't included on the device - it was an extra feature you had to purchase when ordering. There like few hundred on the roads.. Yikes!

I explored the software of the device to understand how it worked. It was a challenging but rewarding process, since I was reverse engineering the software of the Linux machine. In the end, I created a system that worked under certain conditions (these few lines don't capture just how much effort and passion went into making it work).
It was alot of trial by fire/R&D.
I wont go in much details but the stoy but my part end here.
