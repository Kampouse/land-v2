# About Me
Tech enthusiast, cyclist , hobbyst runner and a passionate learner. Finding my way into technology by the back hallways of college.<br/> It led me to 42, Where I consolidated my knowledge and skills around   coding but  software developpent as whole.

##  The Pandemic Year...
I was due to start in  2020 during summer ... it started in march 2021. During that wait, I made the most of my time by doing  learning on my own . I  tried many courses and books   explored different tech stacks, working with frontend technologies like React, ReScript, ReasonML and ClojureScript, plus some Node.js stuff on the side also a litle of nosql (i was not ready yet) .
