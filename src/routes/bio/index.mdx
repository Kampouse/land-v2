# About Me

I never planned to become a developer. With a background in graphic design, I stumbled into coding while trying to customize my portfolio website. One CSS tweak led to another, and suddenly I was knee-deep in JavaScript documentation at 2 AM, completely hooked.

## My Journey

After five years as a designer in Montreal's bustling agency scene, I took the leap to become a full-time developer. The transition wasn't easy—many sleepless nights debugging code and questioning my life choices—but it's been the most rewarding decision I've ever made.

## Current Work

```bash
# My daily tools
React | TypeScript | Node.js | Figma | Coffee ☕
```

I currently work as a Frontend Developer at TechStream, where I bridge the gap between design and engineering. My unique background helps me create interfaces that are both beautiful and functional.

### Recent Project: Wavelength

My team just launched Wavelength, a music discovery platform that connects independent artists with new listeners:

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export const ArtistSpotlight = ({ artistId }) => {
  const [artistData, setArtistData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // My proudest achievement was optimizing this fetch
    // to reduce load times by 73%
    fetchArtistDetails(artistId).then(setArtistData);
  }, [artistId]);

  return artistData ? <ProfileCard data={artistData} /> : <Skeleton />;
};
```

## Side Projects

When I'm not at work, you'll find me:
- Mentoring junior developers at local meetups
- Maintaining my open-source UI component library
- Photographing Montreal's hidden architectural gems
- Attempting to perfect my sourdough bread recipe

I believe in continuous learning, which is why I'm currently exploring WebGL and 3D animations. My journey's just beginning, and I couldn't be more excited about what's next.

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat about design systems!
